# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory stores notebooks that I use for various purposes. Some of these notebooks are here for my own testing of the published APIs. Some of them are to do R&D and run one-off tests. I don't think of these things as "first class" documentation, but I do find it useful to include them for my own sake and in the hopes that maybe it'll help someone else out there.
